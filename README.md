# rock-paper-scissors
This is my first project using Javascript in The Odin Projects foundations course! I'll be making the game Rock Paper Scissors.
This project will give me good practice for Javascript basics and programming in general.
I'll be focusing on coding last and making sure I layout the project in psudocode first and that I have a good outline and design of the project before I jump into coding.
Essentially, I'm going to outline the project algorithmically with comments, then I'll transcribe from plain english into actual Javascript.
So all things considered upfront, with any luck it'll all go off without a hitch.
